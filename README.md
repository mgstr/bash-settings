# Memento

```
Do you remember the curl command line option for setting cookie?
Do you remember the name of the new trending editor from Microsoft that you wanted to try?
Do you remember the command line for removing all exited docker containers?
```

There are a lot of useful information that can fit in one-liner aka Twitter style. You can manage this info using a heavyweight programs like Evernote or OneNote, but there are drawbacks:

* Big footprint on device
* GUI only, no CMD line support
* no Linux support
* limited mobile device support (only 2 device in Evernote) in free version

This project will try to address this issues by implementing a helper probram, that will work with plain text files to provide one-liner information using CMD or on mobile devices using bot in messanger.

name of the project is a reference to the [Memento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)) movie
